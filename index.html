            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Version control is useful tool that allows software designers to record the changes made to their code over time. Version control systems are a good way to protect files from being lost completely, as they will store previous states which can be reverted to. The types of version control systems include local version control systems, centralized version control systems, and distributed version control systems. Each type of version control system has its own benefits to fit the need of a particular type of user. When designing web applications, this makes it significantly easier to track changes and revert to past versions than manually reverting code.</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Created in 2005, Git is one particular system of version control. Git was created with certain goals in mind: speed, simple design, support for non-linear development, full distribution, and the ability to handle large projects efficiently. As a free-of-charge system, Git is widely available to many people. There are some key differences between Git and other version control systems, like the way Git thinks of its data as a stream of snapshots, allowing a more efficient system. With Git, committed snapshots are very difficult to lose. Git also uses three main file states, which are committed, modified, and staged. </p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">To fulfill its main function of managing file changes, Git stores changes repositories. Repositories store commit objects and heads. In order to obtain a Git repository, a developer can either turn a local directory into a Git repository or clone an existing Git repository from an external source. This repository will be created on the local machine. When initializing a Git repository, a new subdirectory named .git will be created, containing all of the necessary repository files ready for use. The repository can then be set to track version changing after doing an initial commit of your project. Knowing how to create a repository is necessary for efficient version tracking.</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Once the Git repository is created, it is time to begin recording changes to the repository. Snapshots are taken and committed each time a project reaches a milestone is reached which is considered necessary to record to prevent losses of important data. In the working directory, files can either be tracked or untracked, where tracked files are in the last snapshot and untracked files are not. There are a certain library of commands to track and commit changes in Git. These include “$ git status”, which checks the status of files to determine their state.</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">GitHub is the largest host for Git repositories. As the largest host, GitHub is home to an extensive library of projects by millions of developers. Starting in 2007, GitHub has hosted 85 million repositories as of June 2018. As a developer using code versioning through Git, it is extremely likely that GitHub will become part of one’s professional career. GitHub allows users to contribute to projects and set up their own repositories quickly and easily with the creation of free or paid account, depending on the needs of the user. </p>
